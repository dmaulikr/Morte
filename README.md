# Morte

Sample iOS game using SpriteKit, featuring dynamic 2D city generation with custom GLSL shader and simple character physics.

It is mostly a copy and paste of examples found on the internet, except for the following "original" contents:

* random city background generation
* custom GLSL shader for buildings
* IK on the character

It was old code for internal use, then ported to iOS9. It's not intented to be a fully featured game, it's mainly a boilerplate and an example.
